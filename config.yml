language: en

# Pipeline for NLU
pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"    # Required for tokenization

  # Language Model Featurizer: to use any pre-trained models(BERT model for featurization)
- name: "LanguageModelFeaturizer"
  model_name: "bert"

  epochs: 100
  constrain_similarities: true
  model_confidence: softmax    # Updated to softmax for valid setting
  intent_classification: true
  entity_recognition: true
  use_transformers: true
  transformer_model_name: "bert-base-uncased"    # Specify the BERT model for fine-tuning
  embedding_dimension: 768    # Set based on BERT (768 for BERT-base)

  # Entity Synonym Mapper to map synonyms

# Configuration for Rasa Core (Dialogue management)
policies:
- name: "MemoizationPolicy"    # Remembers previous conversations for better handling
- name: "RulePolicy"    # Allows defining rule-based conversation flows
  core_fallback_action_name: "action_fallback"
